This file contains information about the original file_operations_controller.py that was in the controllers directory.

The controller was responsible for:
- Managing file system operations
- Handling file selection
- Managing path operations
- Creating directories as needed

It contained a FileOperationsController class with methods for:
- browse_input_file
- browse_output_directory
- handle_file_drop
- update_input_path
- update_output_path
- ensure_output_directory
- get_current_paths

This information was extracted from the compiled .pyc file in the __pycache__ directory.
The actual .py file was missing from the project structure.
