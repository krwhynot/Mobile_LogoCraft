# Background Removal Methods for Mobile LogoCraft

## Overview

This document provides a comprehensive overview of the background removal methods implemented and tested for the Mobile LogoCraft application. The implementation includes both basic methods with minimal dependencies and advanced neural network-based approaches for higher quality results.

## Available Methods

### Standard Methods (No External Dependencies)

1. **Color Threshold Method**
   - Simple RGB value-based thresholding
   - Fast execution with minimal resource requirements
   - Suitable for images with uniform white backgrounds
   - Configurable threshold and tolerance parameters

2. **Chroma Key Method**
   - Similar to green screen technology
   - Calculates Euclidean distance from target color
   - Creates gradient transparency based on color distance
   - Adaptable to different background colors

3. **Contour Detection Method**
   - Uses OpenCV's contour detection algorithm
   - Better edge preservation than simple thresholding
   - Handles shadows and gradients more effectively
   - Good for logos and objects with clear boundaries

4. **GrabCut Method**
   - Implements OpenCV's GrabCut algorithm
   - Advanced segmentation via iterative graph cuts
   - Handles complex objects and backgrounds
   - More computationally intensive but higher quality

### Neural Network Methods (Requires CarveKit)

5. **Tracer-B7**
   - State-of-the-art segmentation network (90% F1-Score)
   - Excellent for general objects and scenes
   - High-quality edge preservation
   - Recommended segmentation mask size: 640px

6. **U^2-Net**
   - Specialized for hair and fine details (80.4% F1-Score)
   - Best for portraits and subjects with fine details
   - Good balance of quality and processing speed
   - Recommended segmentation mask size: 320px

7. **BASNet**
   - General-purpose segmentation (80.3% F1-Score)
   - Effective for objects with clear boundaries
   - Consistent performance across domains
   - Recommended segmentation mask size: 320px

8. **DeepLabV3**
   - Semantic segmentation network (67.4% IoU)
   - Fast inference time for common objects
   - Lower memory requirements
   - Recommended segmentation mask size: 1024px

## Testing Framework

The testing framework evaluates each method based on:

1. **Execution Time**: Measures processing speed
2. **Quality Score**: Evaluates transparency and content preservation
3. **Visual Results**: Saves processed images for visual comparison

### Test Suite Components

- **test_background_removal.py**: Tests standard methods (1-4)
- **test_cravekit_removal.py**: Tests neural network methods (5-8)
- **batch_background_removal_analysis.py**: Advanced parameter optimization

### Running the Tests

#### Option 1: Using the Batch File
```
.\tests\run_background_removal_tests.bat
```

#### Option 2: Using PowerShell
```powershell
.\tests\Run-BackgroundRemovalTests.ps1
```

#### Option 3: Manual Execution
```powershell
# Standard methods only
python tests\test_background_removal.py

# Neural network methods (requires CarveKit)
python tests\test_cravekit_removal.py

# All methods including CarveKit
python tests\test_background_removal.py --with-carvekit

# Advanced parameter testing
python tests\batch_background_removal_analysis.py --methods threshold contour
```

## Expected Results

After running the tests, results are saved to:
- `tests\assets\output\background_removal\`
- `tests\assets\output\carvekit_removal\`

Each output directory contains:
1. Processed images with transparent backgrounds
2. A markdown report with detailed metrics
3. Summary of results by method and image

## Implementation Recommendations

Based on testing results, the recommended implementation strategy is:

1. **Default Method**: Contour Detection
   - Best balance of quality and performance
   - No external dependencies beyond OpenCV
   - Suitable for all image formats

2. **Advanced Option**: Tracer-B7 (via CarveKit)
   - Highest quality results
   - Requires additional dependencies
   - Configurable as an optional premium feature

3. **Format-Specific Optimization**:
   - PUSH format (96×96 px): Contour Detection
   - LOGO format (1024×1024 px): U^2-Net for fine details
   - APPICON format (1024×1024 px): Tracer-B7 for general quality

## Dependencies

### Required Dependencies
- Python 3.9+
- NumPy
