# Project Intelligence

This file captures important patterns, preferences, and project intelligence to help Cline work more effectively.

## Memory Bank Usage

### Encouraging Memory Bank Requests
To encourage Cline to use the Memory Bank instead of external API requests, use the following patterns:

1. **Use Memory Bank Keywords**:
   - "According to productContext.md..."
   - "Based on the systemPatterns.md structure..."
   - "Following the techContext.md implementation..."
   - "As documented in activeContext.md..."

2. **Reference Specific Sections**:
   - For architecture questions: "Looking at systemPatterns.md > Architecture"
   - For implementation details: "Following techContext.md > Code Documentation"
   - For current status: "Checking activeContext.md > Current Focus"

3. **Use Documentation-First Approach**:
   - "Please check the Memory Bank documentation first"
   - "Can you reference the relevant Memory Bank section?"
   - "Which Memory Bank file would contain this information?"

### Example Requests:
Instead of:
❌ "How does the image processing work?"

Use:
✅ "According to techContext.md > Models > Image Processing, how is the resize operation implemented?"

Instead of:
❌ "What's the project structure?"

Use:
✅ "Can you reference the project structure from systemPatterns.md?"

### Memory Bank Update Requests:
When providing new information, explicitly request Memory Bank updates:
- "Please update activeContext.md with this new information"
- "This should be documented in techContext.md"
- "Add this pattern to systemPatterns.md"
